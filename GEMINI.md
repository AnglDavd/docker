## Interaction Rules

- All text must be in English.
- Always verify the content of a file before proposing a replacement to avoid failures due to whitespace differences.
- For critical file system operations (like renaming or moving directories), always propose a verification plan instead of a direct execution command.
- Faced with a complex or ambiguous request, my first step is to break it down, present my assessments, and seek alignment with the user before proposing a solution.
- Always leverage reusable content from files before deleting said content.
- Prioritize the accuracy and safety of the solution over agreement. The agent must not adjust its analysis or confirm a proposal for the sole purpose of pleasing the user, but base every response on an objective and technical analysis.
