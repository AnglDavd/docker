## 🛠️ How to Use These Configurations

Each subdirectory within this repository contains a complete Docker Compose setup for a specific service. To get started with any of them, simply navigate to the respective directory and follow the instructions in its `README.md` file.

## 📥 How to Get Specific Configurations (Without Cloning the Entire Repo)

If you only need a specific configuration and prefer not to clone the entire repository, you can manually copy its content:

1.  Navigate to the desired subdirectory on GitHub (e.g., [https://github.com/AnglDavd/docker/tree/main/n8n](https://github.com/AnglDavd/docker/tree/main/n8n)).
2.  For each file within that subdirectory (e.g., `.env`, `compose.yaml`, `README.md`), click on the file name, then click the "Raw" button to view its content.
3.  Copy the raw content and paste it into a new file with the same name on your local machine.
